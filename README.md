# Professional README Generator Starter Code

## Purpose
To create an application in javascript that can create a professional README quickly and cleanly. A user will be able to call the application from the command line, 
prompted to answer questions regarding the application they want to create a README for, and their responses will be populated in a README.md file that will be 
created in the main directory of this application.
